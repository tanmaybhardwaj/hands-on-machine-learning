### Chapter 1 : Questions and Answers

1. How would you define Machine Learning? 
    - Machine learning is the science of programming computers so they can learn from data to solve a specific problem.

 2. Can you name four types of applications where it shines?
    - Machine learning is great for problems whose solution requires a great deal of work or a long list of rules, complex problems that are
      hard to get a solution of using a traditional method, fluctuating environments and getting insights about complex problems and large data. 
      Some examples are spam detection in email, cancer diagnosis, fraudulent credit card transactions, and automatically driving vehicles.

 3. What is a labeled training set?
    - A labeled training set is a collection of data where one of the features of the data indicates the class the training example belongs to.
      A labeled training set is used in supervised learning algorithms.

 4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?
    - Two most common supervised tasks are classification and regression. In a regression problem we our prediciton is a scalar value. When we're trying to solve a classification problem, our output is either 1 or 0.

 5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
    - Four common unsupervised tasks inclused clustering, visualization, dimensionality reduction , and association rule learning.

 6. What type of algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?
    - I would use a reinforcement learning approach. Reinforcement learning is a system where an "agent" observes the environment, selects and 
      performs actions, then recieves a reward or punishment based on the result of the action. Over time the agent learns by itself what is the 
      most productive strategy.


 7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?
    - I would use some sort of clustering algorithm that can find the decision boundaries in the groups automatically. 
      This is an unsupervised approach. However, if I already knew the categories of my customers, then I would choose a supervised approach 
      and go with a classification algorithm.

 8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?
    - I would frame it as a supervised learning problem because humans have a general idea about what spam is and what it isn't. We can use this 
      notion to create a labeled dataset for an algorithm to learn from.

 9. What is an online learning system?

 10. What is out-of-core learning?

 11. What type of algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?

 12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a model hyperparameter?

 13. What do model-based algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?

 14. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?

 15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?

 16. What is a test set, and why would you want to use it?

 17. What is the purpose of a validation set?

 18. What is the train-dev set, when do you need it, and how do you use it?

 19. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?
