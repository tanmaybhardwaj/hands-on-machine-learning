 1. How would you define Machine Learning? 
    - Machine learning is the science of programming computers so they can learn from data to solve a specific problem.

 2. Can you name four types of applications where it shines?
    - Machine learning is great for problems whose solution requires a great deal of work or a long list of rules, complex problems that are hard to get a solution of using a traditional method, 
      fluctuating environments and getting insights about complex problems and large data. Some examples are spam detection in email, cancer diagnosis, fraudulent credit card transactions, and automatically driving vehicles.

 3. What is a labeled training set?

 4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?

 5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?

 6. What type of algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?

 7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?

 8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?

 9. What is an online learning system?

 10. What is out-of-core learning?

 11. What type of algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?

 12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a model hyperparameter?

 13. What do model-based algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?

 14. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?

 15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?

 16. What is a test set, and why would you want to use it?

 17. What is the purpose of a validation set?

 18. What is the train-dev set, when do you need it, and how do you use it?

 19. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?
